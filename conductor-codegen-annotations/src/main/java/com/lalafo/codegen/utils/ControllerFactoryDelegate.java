/**
 * This interface is used for implementing ControllerFactory code generation with factory delegation.
 * This allowing us to optimize code generation process within incremental annotation processing environment.
 * <p>
 * Each class annotated with {@link com.lalafo.codegen.injection.InjectController} under the hood
 * generates the {@code <YourControllerClassName>_ControllerFactoryDelegate}, that implements
 * {@link ControllerFactoryDelegate ControllerFactoryDelegate&#60;YourControllerClassName&#62;}.
 * <p>
 * Implemented delegates are injected as providers to master {@code ControllerFactory}, annotated with
 * {@link com.lalafo.codegen.factory.ConductorFactory}. As soon as master ConductorFactory finds
 * the matching class to generate it calls {@link ControllerFactoryDelegate#newInstanceWithArguments(Object)}
 * with instantiation arguments.
 * <p>
 * <b>Keep in mind</b>: this interface is <b>not</b> for in project usage outside of generated code.
 * No illegal usage of this will be reported in any form during the compilation process.
 *
 * @param <T> Controller class to instantiate withing the delegate.
